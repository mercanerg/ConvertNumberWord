    If decimal exists, it constructs the word for point value.
    After removing the decimal digits from the number,
    it converts digits, tens, hundreds and thousands by using the functions
    which return a string containing the number in words. <br>
    if user enter "9876", it converts to "$NineThousand EightHundred SeventySix" <br>
    user is  allowed only numeric characters
